Performance and Optimization Improvements
Here are several performance optimizations we could implement:
Server-Side Caching:
Implement Redis or an in-memory cache for API responses
Add cache headers to API responses to enable browser caching
Example implementation for the models API:
Apply
;
Image Optimization:
Implement a proper image CDN (like Cloudinary or ImageKit)
Use Next.js Image component more extensively with proper sizing
Implement WebP and AVIF image formats with fallbacks
Code Splitting and Bundle Optimization:
We're already using dynamic imports for some components, but we could extend this approach
Analyze the bundle size with tools like @next/bundle-analyzer
Implement module/nomodule pattern for better browser compatibility
API Response Size Optimization:
Trim unnecessary fields from API responses
Implement pagination more efficiently
Use compression for API responses
Data Loading Strategies:
Implement SWR or React Query for data fetching with automatic revalidation
Implement Incremental Static Regeneration for frequently visited pages
Use prefetching for common user paths
AI Content Generation Efficiency:
Implement batched content generation to minimize API calls
Use more efficient prompts to reduce token usage
Implement caching for AI-generated content
SEO and Performance Metrics:
Implement structured data (JSON-LD) for better SEO
Optimize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
Add preconnect and DNS prefetch for external resources
