# Theme Migration Report

## Overview
This report details the progress of migrating from the old dark-theme to the new PageTemplate component system.

## Files to Migrate
- [home.js](src/pages/home.js)
- [models-wanted.js](src/pages/models-wanted.js)
- [sitemap.js](src/pages/sitemap.js)
- [test.js](src/pages/test.js)
- [trans.js](src/pages/trans.js)

## Migration Process
For each file:
1. A backup is created with the extension `.bak`
2. A new version is created in the `migrations/` directory
3. Manual review and integration is required

## Manual Steps Required
For each migrated file:
1. Review the extracted metadata and content
2. Migrate any custom functionality from the original file
3. Test the new version thoroughly
4. Replace the original file with the migrated version

## Benefits of Migration
- **Consistency:** All pages use the same component structure
- **Maintainability:** Easier to update global layout elements
- **Performance:** Reduced bundle size by eliminating duplicate code
- **Modern Styling:** Consistent modern UI across all pages

## Next Steps
1. Review all migrated files in the `migrations/` directory
2. Test each page after migration
3. Update any imports in other files as needed
4. Delete the old `dark-themeLive` directory after all migrations are complete
