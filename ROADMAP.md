## Technical Documentation

### Standardized Page Structure
All pages now follow a consistent structure:

```
├── header_module          → Top nav bar with language switcher, logo, and global nav
├── sidebar_module         → Filterable sidebar based on dynamic API attributes
├── toptext_module         → Category description or editorial content
├── modelGrid_module       → Core feed view (models or videos depending on route)
├── bottomText_module      → SEO/editorial block (AI or static content)
├── relevantContent_module → Related blog posts / models / cross-content
└── footer_module          → Single, stable footer (NOT duplicated)
```

This structure is implemented through the `UnifiedLayout` component which is used by all pages via the `ThemeLayout` wrapper.

### Theme Configuration
Theme settings are now centralized in `src/theme/theme.config.js`, including:
- Color palettes
- Font configuration
- Layout dimensions
- Module configuration

### Route Structure
- `/` - Home page
- `/girls` - Main girls category
- `/girls/[subcategory]` - Girls subcategories (asian, ebony, etc.)
- `/trans` - Main trans category
- `/trans/[subcategory]` - Trans subcategories
- `/free` - Redirects to free/girls
- `/free/[subcategory]` - Free subcategories
- `/videos` - Main videos category
- `/videos/[subcategory]` - Video subcategories
- `/models/[slug]` - Model profile pages
- `/blog/[slug]` - Blog posts

## Current Status (v0.1.0)

- ✅ Core Next.js platform structure implemented
- ✅ AI content generation system integrated
  - ✅ Model content writer
  - ✅ Category content writer
  - ✅ Blog content writer
  - ✅ Page content writer
- ✅ Utility scripts for setup and data synchronization
- ✅ CLI tools for manual content generation
- ⚠️ Data directory structure established but limited content
- ⚠️ Basic page rendering without complete styling

- Error handling in AI generation needs improvement
- Some hardcoded paths should be moved to configuration
- Component architecture needs standardization

### Planned Refactoring

- [ ] Centralize all configuration into a unified config system
- [ ] Standardize error handling across services
- [ ] Create proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- [ ] Implement proper testing framework (Jest/React Testing Library)

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- Use TypeScript for all new components and services
- Follow ESLint configured rules
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Document all functions, parameters, and return values

### Commit Standards

- Use conventional commits format: `type(scope): message`
  - `feat`: new feature
  - `fix`: bug fix
  - `docs`: documentation changes
  - `style`: formatting, linting
  - `refactor`: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `perf`: performance improvements
  - `test`: adding or updating tests
  - `chore`: updating build tasks, package manager configs

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch for feature integration
- `feature/*` - Individual features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

## Integration Points

### AI Services

- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for content generation
- Potentially explore using DALL-E or Midjourney for image generation

### Third-Party Services

- Analytics integration (Google Analytics)
- Monitoring and error tracking (Sentry)
- Newsletter services

## Deployment Strategy

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel for hosting and preview environments
- Staging environment for QA testing before production

## Documentation Needs

- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Component storybook or showcase
- [ ] Content structure and schema documentation
- [ ] Developer onboarding guide
- [ ] AI prompt engineering guidelines
