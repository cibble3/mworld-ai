# MistressWorld - Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development path for the MistressWorld platform. It serves as a communication tool between development teams and AI copilots working on the project.

## Current Status (v0.1.0)

- ✅ Core Next.js platform structure implemented
- ✅ AI content generation system integrated
  - ✅ Model content writer
  - ✅ Category content writer
  - ✅ Blog content writer
  - ✅ Page content writer
- ✅ Utility scripts for setup and data synchronization
- ✅ CLI tools for manual content generation
- ⚠️ Data directory structure established but limited content
- ⚠️ Basic page rendering without complete styling
- ❌ Complete component library for content display

## Short-Term Goals (v0.2.0)

### Data Generation and Structure

- [ ] Create seed content for essential pages
  - [ ] Generate home page content with featured sections
  - [ ] Generate at least 5 model profiles per category (25+ total)
  - [ ] Generate main category pages (asian, ebony, latina, white, transgender)
  - [ ] Generate 10+ blog posts covering trending topics

### UI Development

- [ ] Develop core UI components
  - [ ] Model card and grid displays
  - [ ] Category navigation and display
  - [ ] Blog post preview and full view
  - [ ] Hero sections and banners
  - [ ] Search interface

### Data Flow & API

- [ ] Optimize data loading strategies
  - [ ] Implement static generation for content pages
  - [ ] Add incremental static regeneration for dynamic content
  - [ ] Create unified data fetch hooks

## Medium-Term Goals (v0.5.0)

### Enhanced AI Systems

- [ ] Improve AI content generation
  - [ ] Add ability to regenerate specific sections of content
  - [ ] Implement content quality scoring system
  - [ ] Add image suggestion capabilities
  - [ ] Develop more sophisticated prompting techniques

### User Experience

- [ ] Enhance navigation and discoverability
  - [ ] Implement advanced filtering and search
  - [ ] Add "related content" suggestions
  - [ ] Implement infinite scroll and pagination
  - [ ] Optimize mobile experience

### Performance & Infrastructure

- [ ] Optimize site performance
  - [ ] Add code splitting and lazy loading
  - [ ] Optimize image delivery with modern formats
  - [ ] Implement edge caching strategies
  - [ ] Add metrics and monitoring

## Long-Term Goals (v1.0+)

### Advanced Features

- [ ] User personalization
  - [ ] Implement user accounts/profiles
  - [ ] Add favorites and saved content
  - [ ] Develop personalized recommendations

### Content Expansion

- [ ] Diversify content types
  - [ ] Add video content integration
  - [ ] Implement galleries and slideshows
  - [ ] Add interactive elements
  - [ ] Schedule regular content refreshes

### Platform Growth

- [ ] Internationalization and localization
  - [ ] Translate UI to multiple languages
  - [ ] Generate content in multiple languages
  - [ ] Add region-specific content adaptation

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Current Technical Debt

- Content synchronization between `src/data` and `public/data` could be more efficient
- Error handling in AI generation needs improvement
- Some hardcoded paths should be moved to configuration
- Component architecture needs standardization

### Planned Refactoring

- [ ] Centralize all configuration into a unified config system
- [ ] Standardize error handling across services
- [ ] Create proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- [ ] Implement proper testing framework (Jest/React Testing Library)

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- Use TypeScript for all new components and services
- Follow ESLint configured rules
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Document all functions, parameters, and return values

### Commit Standards

- Use conventional commits format: `type(scope): message`
  - `feat`: new feature
  - `fix`: bug fix
  - `docs`: documentation changes
  - `style`: formatting, linting
  - `refactor`: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `perf`: performance improvements
  - `test`: adding or updating tests
  - `chore`: updating build tasks, package manager configs

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch for feature integration
- `feature/*` - Individual features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

## Integration Points

### AI Services

- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for content generation
- Potentially explore using DALL-E or Midjourney for image generation

### Third-Party Services

- Analytics integration (Google Analytics)
- Monitoring and error tracking (Sentry)
- Newsletter services

## Deployment Strategy

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel for hosting and preview environments
- Staging environment for QA testing before production

## Documentation Needs

- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Component storybook or showcase
- [ ] Content structure and schema documentation
- [ ] Developer onboarding guide
- [ ] AI prompt engineering guidelines
